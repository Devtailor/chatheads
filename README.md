# Chat heads

**Disclaimer: The code is a very rough hackathon code, especially commited by Igor Krupenja on 22.04 ðŸ˜„**

## Getting Started

1. Make sure node v18 is installed.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Add ChatGPT API key to `src/constants/env.ts` in the following format:

```ts
export const chatGptApiKey = 'sk-dummy-key';
```

TODO: This should be in `.env` file in the future.

4. Run the development server with `npm run dev`.
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
